        <p>Payday loans are but one of many financial techniques - from overdraft fees to student loans subsidizing for-profit colleges - specifically designed to pull money from the pockets of the poor. This problem generally goes unrecognized by policy makers.

            By taking gold loans, one can maintain liquidity in his finance, without selling off any asset or the gold itself. Gold works as a security for getting a required amount of finance from any bank. The most attractive part of these loans is that the loan is given for an amount which is more than 80% of the value.
